# workspacer_config


This is my custom config of `workspacer`. In order to use it you must have `workspacer` already installed (find it [here](https://www.workspacer.org/)).

Then:

  - Go into your home folder, on Windows it should be something like `C:\Users\{user}`
  - In that home folder of yours, clone the repo into a `.workspacer` folder by running:
  
  `git clone "https://github.com/mushogenshin/workspacer_config.git" "./.workspacer"`

That's it, you should restart `workspacer` in order to see the effects.

# Keybinds

My custom keybinds is virtually the same as [the default keybinds](https://www.workspacer.org/keybindings), but instead of just using `Alt` as one modifier as in the default keybinds, I use `Win` + `Alt` together as modifiers. 

This is so that my `workspacer` keybinds can still work simultaneously with a lot of other hotkeys that I regularly use in my 3D softwares.

# Filters

  - Window with title containing `Snipping` is filtered to `false` so that I can still make snips while using `workspacer`
